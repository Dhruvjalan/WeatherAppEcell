# Weather App
This is the second project for my training phase in E-Cell, IIT Madras. 

This is a simple weather-application that utilises the Open Weather Map API and displays the weather conditions of a particular place. 
We can find the place's weather forcast by:
1. By the City and Country Name
2. By the coordinates (Latitude and Longitude)

The Weather App displays a variety of information including:
1. Average, Minnimum and Maximum Temperature.
2. The sunset and sunrise timings along with the coordinates of the place.
3. Precipitation Probability
4. Average Cloud Cover
5. Average Humidity
6. Average Visbility
7. It also shows time specific forcast for the next 12 hours with information about humidity, precipitation probability and temperature.
